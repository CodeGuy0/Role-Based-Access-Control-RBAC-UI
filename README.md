# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI
This project is a Role-Based Authentication & Authorization System built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application enables administrators to efficiently manage users, roles, and permissions in a secure and user-friendly interface.

# Features
# 1. User Management
View, add, edit, or delete users.<br>
Assign roles to users and manage their status (Active/Inactive).
# 2. Role Management
Create, view, and manage roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Viewer).<br>
Assign specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete) to roles.
# 3. Permission Management
Define permissions dynamically and assign them to roles.<br>
Display roles and their permissions in an intuitive UI for easy modification.
# 4. Authentication & Authorization
Secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).<br>
Restrict access to specific UI components or features based on roles.
# 5. Responsive Design
Fully responsive UI, ensuring compatibility across devices and screen sizes.
# Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js with CSS<br>
Backend: Node.js and Express.js<br>
Database: MongoDB<br>
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)<br>
State Management: Context API or Redux
